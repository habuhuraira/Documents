Advantages of the Waterfall Model:
Waterfall model uses a clear structure.
The waterfall model's evolution is simple to understand.
The waterfall approach establishes the end goal early in the process.
When compared to other approaches, it conveys information more effectively.
The waterfall model limits the duration of a project.

Disadvantages of the Waterfall Model:
The waterfall model does not allow for adjustments to be made.
It has the potential to invalidate any past effort you've done.
End-users and clients are not included in this strategy.
It postpones testing until after the project is completed.
Longer delivery periods are possible with the waterfall paradigm.

When to use:
The model is used when the requirements are well known, clear and fixed.
The project is large.
Also used when working on an experienced project.

V-Model 
Advantages of V-Model:
It's simple and easy to use.
The model has applicability in situations where requirements are well defined and stable.
Testing tasks like as planning and developing tests take place prior to coding.
Quick and saves time
As a result, the waterfall model has a better probability of succeeding.

Disadvantages of V-Model:
Very strict.
The least adaptable.
Because software is developed during the implementation phase, no early prototypes are created.
If any modifications occur in the middle of the project, the test documents, as well as the requirement documents, must be updated.
V-Model is risky.

When to use:
The project is short and the technology is understood.
The product definition is clear.
When need to describe the development of the system and its subsystems.

Incremental Model 

Advantages of Incremental model:
More flexible in working and addition of new functionality	
Less costly to change scope and requirements	
Easier to test and debug during a smaller iteration	
High customer interaction with review and feedback to each build	
Generates working software quickly and early during the software life cycle
Disadvantages of Incremental model:
Needs good planning and design.
Needs a clear and complete definition of the whole system before start design
Functionality divination takes more time
Total cost is higher than waterfall model.
It requires more customer involvement than the other linear approaches.
When to use:
When the requirements are superior.
A project has a lengthy development schedule.
When the customer demands a quick release of the product.

Prototyping Model 

Advantages of prototyping model:
The users are actively involved in the creation of the product.
Because a functioning model of the system is provided as part of this process, users gain a better knowledge of the system being developed.
Errors can be identified considerably earlier in the process.
User feedback is provided more quickly, resulting in better solutions.
It's simple to spot missing functionality.

Disadvantages of Incremental model:
This type is quite pricey.
Because of the constantly changing customer needs, it has weak documentation.
There may be an excessive amount of variety in requirements.
After witnessing an early prototype, customers may demand that the final product be supplied as quickly as possible.
